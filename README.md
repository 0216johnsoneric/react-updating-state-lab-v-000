# React Updating State Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice updating state using `setState()`
2. Explain the difference between a React SyntheticEvent and a DOM Event
3. Practice using controlled form components

## Overview

As usual, we want students to practice what the reading has covered. We can
start homing in on the difference between props and state here, as it will
be useful to them pretty much always going forward.

The components students build in this lab should be a bit larger than in
previous labs, but not gargantuan yet.
